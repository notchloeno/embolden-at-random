# EmboldenAtRandom
### How to install
The process is relatively simple:
* [Download the extension as a .zip](https://github.com/notjoshno/embolden-at-random/archive/master.zip)
* Extract the .zip file into a folder somewhere on your computer. If this folder is deleted your extension will no longer work.
* Go to your [Chrome extensions page](chrome://extensions)
* At the top-right, enable Developer Mode
* At the top-left click "Load unpacked"
* In the explorer window, find and select the folder you extracted the .zip into
* At the top right of chrome, next to the URL bar, there should be a small puzzle icon. This is your extensions options menu.
* Click the puzzle icon, and pin EmboldenAtRandom
* The extension is now installed! Simply navigate to a webpage with a lot of text and click the icon at the top-right to embolden some stuff.

### Why is this not on the Chrome Extension Market?
There is a $5 registration fee and I am currently bankrupt, sorry!

### About the project:
This is a Chrome extension that adds an icon to your taskbar which, when clicked, randomly changes randomly sized chunks of text on a web-page to be bold.
This was inspired by a comment on [Reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/k2vw05/i_cant_fucking_read/gdxqe3h?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

This is the first Chrome extension I've ever made, and it was cobbled together between the hours of 5am-8am.
This is also my first time working with JQuery, and the Chrome extension libraries.
I am also not super-familiar with JavaScript, with Python being my usual language of choice.

Therefore, I invite anyone who can to come and help turn this janky-ass extension into something that works a bit nicer.

### Note:
This extension only changes text contained within `<p></p>` or `<span></span>` tags, and can break some websites' formatting/
If a website doesn't like the extension's reformatting decisions, simply refresh and it will revert to normal.
