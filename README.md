# EmboldenAtRandom
This is a Chrome extension that adds an icon to your taskbar which, when clicked, randomly changes randomly sized chunks of text on a web-page to be bold.
This was inspired by a comment on [Reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/k2vw05/i_cant_fucking_read/gdxqe3h?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

This is the first Chrome extension I've ever made, and it was cobbled together between the hours of 5am-8am.
This is also my first time working with JQuery, and the Chrome extension libraries.
I am also not super-familiar with JavaScript, with Python being my usual language of choice.

Therefore, I invite anyone who can to come and help turn this janky-ass extension into something that works a bit nicer.

### Note:
This extension only changes text contained within <p>paragraph</p> or <span>span</span> tags, and can break some websites' formatting/
If a website doesn't like the extension's reformatting decisions, simply refresh and it will revert to normal.
